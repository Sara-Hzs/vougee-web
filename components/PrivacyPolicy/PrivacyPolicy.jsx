                <h2>2. How we use your data?</h2>
                <p>The processing of data in decentralized, public networks, in particular in the case of blockchains,
                    takes place independently
                    (free will, consent) by the user. For this purpose, VouGee offers functions at certain points in its
                    app, the activation of which requires the explicit consent of the
                    user and is explained as leaving the area of responsibility of VouGee and relieving VouGee of any
                    responsibility within the meaning of the GDPR and all other hereby applicable regulations.</p>
                <p>We set out the general categories of personal data that we may process, the systems where we process
                    it, the source and
                    specific categories of that data, the purposes for which we may process personal data, and the legal
                    bases of the processing as follows:</p>
                <p>The VouGee App allows you to connect to a blockchain and so check, receive and send crypto assets
                    ('coins' and 'tokens') from and to your private key within the blockchain. We developed the app with
                    the highest grade of diligence and strongly comply to the principles of 'Security by design'.
                    Strong wallet encryption and cryptography ensure that your funds will remain under your ultimate
                    control. Your private key never leaves your device if;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the device is not compromised (got hacked) by third (unknown) parties and</li>
                    <li>the restore key / pass phrase is not transmitted to another place, or has been made available to
                        others (third parties).
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>You need no registration and no input of any personal data to use the VouGee app. We do not process
                    any personal data in our VouGee app, also not your IP address or other meta data. Per design there
                    is no function within the app available which allows anyone to input and/or receive any personal
                    data (also not from outside/third party systems). So all the rest of the data stays anonymous within
                    the scope of our app. We have no
                    access to your data within the app, the app acts in a decentralized way under ONLY your ultimate
                    control. When you are using the app there is;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>no registration</li>
                    <li>no support possibility</li>
                    <li>no KYC (know your customer)</li>
                    <li>no identity linking</li>
                    <li>no bureaucracy for transmitting coins</li>
                    <li>no access restriction to your funds</li>
                    <li>no transaction restriction (limit)</li>
                    <li>no IP association and tracking</li>
                    <li>no transaction tracking</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The VouGee app can be obtain through following distribution channels ONLY, the Playstore (Android
                    devices) or the Appstore (Apple devices). There is no warranty that the service might work properly
                    if you obtain it from other sources.</p>
                <p>We strongly point out that we are not responsible for any data loss, loss of your private key and/or
                    the restore key, data breach or other damage (also financial and probably further financial ones)
                    when you are using the decentralized app. The security and safety of your device is totally under
                    your responsibility. Also we'll be never able to
                    restore your private key within the app as well as we are not able to access your app in any way for
                    service or maintenance purpose.</p>

                <h2>3. Persons legal capacity</h2>
                <p>If the legal capacity and so business ability for settling a deal is not given (this is affecting in
                    common under aged persons or persons with other disabilities), back settlement can be arranged
                    directly between the (former/initial) contracting parties within the system by sending the
                    corresponding coins back (or exchanging it in fiat) through
                    our app and the blockchain. This is not under our control, so we can not assist you or enforce any
                    business activity in case of a conflict with another party.</p>
                <p>In case this is affecting deposits or withdraws through our website we have to point out, that only
                    persons which are allowed to hold a bank account are able to register and so to deposit or withdraw.
                    This is additionally only possible if the bank account is SEPA compliant. In the case of an issue
                    please contact
                    the corresponding bank institution (your bank) or payment provider (your payment provider) which
                    allowed you to settle the transaction to sell or buy coins.</p>
                <p>We strongly point out that VouGee cannot prevent or draw back any transaction because of the
                    intrinsic behaviour of the underlying blockchain principles. We are not responsible for any
                    transaction within the blockchain, nevertheless you use our systems (website or app) or other means
                    (apps) todo so. You are fully and self
                    responsible for all your actions and all those of people whose guardian you are (under aged people
                    under your guidance, your kids, mentally impaired persons, etc.).</p>

                <p>You therefore commit conclusively - when using the app - to indemnify and hold us harmless.</p>

                <h2>4. Personal Data</h2>
                <p>We process the following personal data of your mobile device within our app:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Phone number</li>

                </ul>
                <p>If you grant us the right through Android/iOS we will process all data of your contacts. The legal
                    basis for this processing is consent.
                    This data is needed to send or receive coins to your contacts. The data we process will be provided
                    to our app through functions provided by Android/iOS as well as steered
                    by the current policy of Google/Apple. You will be asked explicitly by Android/iOS to grant us
                    access. Generally we use following data to produce a unique hash of a contact record:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mobile/cell phone number</li>
                    <li>Firstname</li>
                    <li>Lastname</li>
                    <li>Address (street name, street number, town/locality, zip, state and country - as available)</li>
                    <li>Email</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your wallet address and public key you receive once and all your transactions are stored within the
                    blockchain. this means this data is always public
                    available. This data is generally anonymous and there is no relation to your wallet address or
                    personality possible outside of the app if you don't
                    publish this information through other means or tell it to your contacts. Except your contacts we'll
                    never give this personal data and
                    the releation-data to other systems.</p>
                <p>If you deny granting us access to your contacts and so deny to process data of your contacts or if
                    you revoke the right to process it later on you won't
                    be able to send or receive coins through your address book. All other functionality of the app will
                    be not affected by revoking this right.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>5. Providing your personal data to others or vice versa</h2>
                <p>We do not disclose your personal data to any other party except your contacts if you trigger this
                    action and grant access to your contacts.</p>

                <p>You actively, if enabled and rights are granted (see previous chapter 4) can connect to your contacts
                    and send or receive coins to/from them through our app ("contact functionality).</p>

                <p>Do not supply any other person's personal data to us, unless we prompt you to do so. Do not provide
                    any data to us through other channels than our official ones shown on our website www.vougee.com
                    and/or www.vougee.gmbh. We are not responsible for the actions of third parties who pose as us -
                    thus check twice!</p>

                <h2>6. Retaining and deleting personal data</h2>
                <p>Personal data that the app processes for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is
                    necessary for that purpose or
                    those purposes. As long as you want use the contacts functionality grant the app the right. If you
                    revoke it, no data within the app will be left.</p>

                <p>If rights are withdrawn or all data is deleted from the phone / device, or if the telephone number,
                    or the app settings are removed or changed, the personal key (private key) can also be deleted. We
                    would like to point out that we are not responsible for any loss/damage of any kind or any
                    consequential damage when this happens.
                    You are hereby aware that the the recovery key and pass phrase must be backed up, stored completely
                    and correctly on a very secure place only you know.</p>

                <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
                <p>In this Section, we have summarized the rights that you have under data protection law. Some rights
                    are complex, and not all details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read
                    the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these
                    rights - in particular those of the GDPR - see GDPR at EUR Lex.</p>
                <p>Your principal rights under data protection law (GDPR), which might become effective here are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the right to access;</li>
                    <li>the right to rectification;</li>
                    <li>the right to erasure;</li>

                    <li>and the right to withdraw consent.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your data never leaves the app without your consents.</li>
                    <li>Zhe data is under your ultimate control - you grant or revoke access to the only source, your
                        contacts (address book).
                    </li>
                    <li>Only your phone number is used within the app but never published.</li>
                    <li>There is no data stored anywhere else than in your device.</li>
                    <li>Hashes of your contacts are one way encrypted and so anonymized by priciple.</li>
                    <li>The app does not transmit any personal data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cannot supply to you any personal data and/or delete it (it is only on your device).</li>
                    <li>Cannot restrict the processing (because there is none available to us).</li>
                    <li>Have no control over your app (because there is no way to connect to).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You have the right to confirmation whether our app process your personal data by</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Installing the app</li>
                    <li>(Optional) Granting access to your address book (contacts) on your device.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To the extent that the legal basis for the processing of your personal data is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consent;</li>
                    <li>And that the processing is necessary for the performance of the app and its functionality (if
                        you
                        wish so).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you consider that the processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you
                    have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data
                    protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or
                    the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
                <p>To the extent that the legal basis for the processing of your personal information is consent, you
                    have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Revoking access to your address book (contacts) and/or</li>
                    <li>Deinstalling the app and/or</li>
                    <li>Deleting your keys (and/or your restore key) in the app data</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. Your transactions in
                    the blockchain will stay untouched from these actions too and will be persistent. It is technically
                    impossible
                    to delete transactions (your keys) in the blockchain, you will be aware of this fact and your
                    agreement to this is implied as soon as you install the app.</p>
                <p>Please note: The revocation and deletion of the data on your device also deletes any
                    information/relationship to the coins and thus financial values. Even if these remain in the
                    blockchain, access to them is then impossible. After installing the app, we therefore recommend that
                    you keep the recovery key (word combination) in a safe place outside of the app that is not
                    accessible to
                    third parties and is only known to you. We state here once again that we are not liable for
                    financial losses and consequential damage!</p>
