                <h3>1. Content of this website:</h3>
                <p>The individual pages of this website have been carefully edited and checked. However, the provider
                    does not accept any liability for the topicality, correctness, completeness or quality of the
                    information provided. Liability claims against the provider relating to material or immaterial
                    damage caused by the use or non-use of the information provided or by the use of incorrect or
                    incomplete information are fundamentally excluded, unless the provider can be shown to have acted
                    with willful intent or gross negligence is present. The provider expressly reserves the right to
                    change, add to, or delete parts of the pages or the entire offer or to cease publication temporarily
                    or permanently without prior notice.</p>


                <h3>2. Links and 3rd party content</h3>
                <p>In the case of direct or indirect references to external websites ("hyperlinks") that are outside the
                    operator's area of ​​responsibility,
                    liability would only come into effect if the operator was aware of the content and it would be
                    technically possible and reasonable for him to do so to prevent
                    use in the event of illegal content. The operator hereby expressly declares that at the time the
                    link was set, no illegal content was recognizable on the linked pages.
                    The operator has no influence on the current and future design, content or authorship of the linked
                    / connected pages. He therefore hereby expressly distances himself from all content
                    on all linked / connected pages that have been changed after the link was set. This statement
                    applies to all links and references set within the company's own website, as well as to third-party
                    entries in guest books, discussion forums, link directories, mailing lists and all other forms of
                    databases to whose content external write access is possible. The provider of the linked website is
                    solely liable for illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and, in particular, for damage resulting
                    from the use or non-use of information presented in this way.</p>


                <h3>3. Author and trademark</h3>
                <p>The operator endeavors to observe the copyrights of the images, graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts used in all publications, to use images, graphics,
                    sound documents, video sequences and texts created by himself or to use license-free graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts . All brands and trademarks named on
                    the website and possibly protected by third parties are subject without restriction to the provisions of the applicable trademark law and the ownership rights of the respective registered
                    owner. The conclusion that trademarks are not protected by the rights of third parties should not be drawn simply because they are mentioned. The copyright for published data or content created
                    by the operator remains solely with the operator of the pages. Duplication or use of these in other electronic or printed publications is not permitted without the operator's express consent.
